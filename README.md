# Continuous Reachability Task Transition Using Control Barrier Functions

This repository contains code to simulate the experiments in our paper titled, "Continuous Reachability Task Transition Using Control Barrier Functions", accepted for publication at the 2020 IFAC World Congress.

In order to execute the code, please follow the instructions:

* First, run the "init.m" file to initialize the Robotarium environment
* Next, in the "Robotarium_Implementation" folder, run the "main.m" file to run our proposed framework
* The vanilla QP switching framework is provided in the "Vanilla_QP_Robotarium" folder. Run the "main_vanilla.m" file in that folder to run the vanilla framework
